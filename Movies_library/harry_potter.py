Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. \
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. {noun2} had never seen anything \
so beautiful and sad. Its {adj1}, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it \
had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\
{noun3} had taken one step toward it when a {verb2} sound made him freeze\
where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing {verb3}. . . . Then, out of the\
shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking\
beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the\
unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink\
its blood.\
“AAAAAAAAAAARGH!”\
Malfoy let out a {adj2} scream and bolted—so did Fang. The hooded figure\
raised its head and looked right at Harry—unicorn blood was {verb4} down its\
front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry—he couldn’t move for fear."
